This is not an offical something.host help guide, use this at your own risk

### 1. Purchase a Something.Host App Box service ([Click Here](https://something.host/en/products/discord-bot-hosting))

### 2. Head over to your services console, you will need to setup the programming language, which for DBM is node.js. Select Node 16.6, leave Setup command blank (we will change this later) [SetupYourSomethingService](http://timmyis.gay/images/chrome_nAhSBcSGkq.png)

### 2. Create your DBM Bot and navigate to your bot directory
